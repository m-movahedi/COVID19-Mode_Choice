# COVID19 and the Mode Choice
** This is an ongoing research project about the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on the transportation mode choice.**

COVID-19 has been designated as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The changes that this disease brought to our day to day life were so radical and bold that it made us think about the future of our world. As today many cities across the globe experience quarantine and mobility restrictions. These changes drive many businesses and people out of their comfort zone and allow them to experience new things like internet shopping, teleworking, or e-learning. As a result, many experts suspect whether these changes would reshape the world as we knew it.

Despite many other countries, Iran adopts a unique strategy to manage and control this crisis. Although we record a considerable number of patients and death during this pandemic, due to the current economic state there were no stiff mobility restrictions or nation-wide quarantine applied to this day. On the other hand, many people start abandoning public transportation and shift to private cars and bicycles or try teleworking.

This global pandemic can draw a completely different future for urban transportation. In the aftermath, we could encounter a significant push back to use public transit. However, there is an opportunity to change travel behavior and shift it toward a more sustainable, clean modes like cycling and walking. To understand these behavior changes, our team designed a survey. This research is conducting under a collaboration with the University of Tehran and Iran University of Science and Technology. The survey is accessible from the following link in Persian.
